/**

\page Usage Interaction Details

This library is designed to be called from another CPP project.

These are mostly header-only functions with dependecies on <b>cbicaUtilities</b>.

Developers' note:

To use this, just go through the documentation and take the headers which are useful for your application. 

For instance, if you need Command line parsing, just take <b>cbicaCmdParser</b> (.h and .cpp) and its specific dependency, i.e., <b>cbicaUtilities</b> (.h and .cpp) and integrate into your project's compilation.

/**

\page Usage

This library is designed to be called from another CPP project.

These are mostly header-only functions with dependecies on <code>cbicaUtilities</code>.

Developers' note:

To use this, just go through the documentation and take the headers which are useful for your application. 

For instance, if you need Command line parsing, just take cbicaCmdParser (.h and .cpp) and its specific dependency, i.e., cbicaUtilities (.h and .cpp) and integrate into your project's compilation.
